# Enigma-Refactoring

This challenge consisted of refactoring a code. What this means is that the existing code has been restructured while keeping the initial behavior. I converted the non-semantic elements to semantic elements to make the code look as smooth as possible. I have also added ALT attributes to the images and fixed links in the HTML. Additionally, I added comments before HTML tags and CSS selectors.
